#Wellcome weather

Showing an image from [Wellcome Images](http://wellcomeimages.org/) that matches the current weather in London, UK. Why London? Because that's where Wellcome Images and the [Wellcome Library](http://wellcomelibrary.org/) are.

Inspired by/stolen from [#tateweather] (https://twitter.com/hashtag/tateweather) . The Tate shows pictures from its collections, which match the weather forecast, on the London Underground.
